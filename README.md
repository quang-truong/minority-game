# How Should We Collude in the Minority Game

In order to run the program, just execute main.py
There will be 14 experiments in total. Experiments 1-7 should run relatively fast. Experiments 8-13 are slow (may take up to 10 hours in total) because they repeat the experiments 8-13 for 100 times. Experiment 14 is not included in the report due to time-constraint. Figures should be automatically stored in /figures.

I also included a log.txt for experiments 8,9, 10, and 11, which returns statistics of 100 experiments. I forgot to include the statstics of experiments 12 and 13, but if you run it on your machine, it should return on the terminal.
